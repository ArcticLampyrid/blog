学校小三模，做到一篇讲述家庭旅行禁止使用手机的读后续写（出处应该是 [广州2021.12高三英语调研卷](https://zujuan.xkw.com/12p1157569.html)），来这一写一写。

实在是不知何时，这种反科技的“禁手机潮”开始大行其道了（至少在舆论阵地上是如此）。个人观点，这种对技术的盲目恐惧和抵制，本质上和破坏铁路救大清的做法没什么区别的。

推崇与自然的紧密接触的实质是推广和谐共生的一种价值观，是一种欣赏万物、尊敬自然的人生境界，而不是其本身的各种形式。将其实践为对科技的限制，甚至归罪于科技的发展，这是一种悲哀。

私以为，自然地运用科技的同时沉醉山河之美，吟赏烟霞，于无为中尊敬世间万物，于漫游中从自然获得启迪，才应是自然主义者式的追求。

> 
> Kathy's family vacation to the beach was usually the highlight of her summer. This year, however, her parents announced a new rule: no phones for the entire week.
> 
> "But my friends will be expecting updates about the trip, " Kathy complained. Kathy's mom gave her a serious look. Unwillingly, Kathy handed her phone over and her mom locked it away.
> 
> The drive to the beach house took most of the day. As they turned off the highway onto country back roads, the clouds darkened. Rain started to pour. "Even more beautiful in the rain," her mother said. " What do you think, Kathy?" Kathy glared at her mom. "Beautiful, "she muttered.
> 
> That night after dinner, Kathy wandered into the kitchen, where her father was washing dishes. She gave her father a loving look and said in her sweetest voice, "Couldn’t I have my phone back, just for one second? Just so I can tell everyone what an amazing time I'm having?”
> 
> "Can't, " he said. "It's not here. Remember?" Kathy was very annoyed. Having nothing better to do, she examined the dusty bookcase in the living room. The books looked as dull as the weather. On the top shelf, however, she spotted a puzzle. She took it, emptied the pieces on the table, and began to sort them.
> 
> After what seemed like a few minutes, she looked up. It was past ten o'clock. She had been working for almost two hours! She yawned. The puzzle was less than half done, but she was exhausted. So, she went to bed.
> 
> When Kathy awoke the next morning, she jumped out of bed and threw open the curtains. A blazing sun was rising over the blue ocean. The sky was cloudless. The scene reminded Kathy of a photo that her friend betty had recently sent her.
> 
> This view was even better. It would leave everyone speechless. Kathy dashed to her bedside table and reached for her phone. But there was nothing there. She sighed. Still, she wandered in front of the window, admiring the sunrise.
> 
> After a quick breakfast, Kathy headed to the beach. ________
> 
> Appreciating the finished puzzle, she realized she hadn't thought of her cellphone for hours. ________
